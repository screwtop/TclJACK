What commands do I want for this thing, and what arguments should they support?  I.e. user interface design. ;^)

# Connecting to JACK server.
# Should we support multiple connections?  What would Fons do...? ;^)
# "connect" or "register"?  I think "register" is more correct; the term "connect" should probably be reserved for establishing port connections!
jack register [ -server <servername> ]
jack deregister [ -server <servername> ]
# i.e., register/deregister this client with the specified JACK server.

# Obtaining information from the JACK server:
jack query ... OR jack info ...
	samplerate
	load (i.e. CPU DSP load)
	period_size
	num_periods
	capture_ports	OR source_ports OR in_ports
	playback_ports	OR sink_ports OR out_ports
	client name (may be auto-modified by server for uniqueness)

# Ideally we'd allow you to create and destroy input ports for monitoring/metering.  These could optionally have a supplied name.
jack port create ...
jack port destroy ...
# Actually, it's meters we're creating destroying, so maybe:
jack meter create [-name] <name>
jack meter destroy [-name] <name>

# Managing port-to-port connections:
jack connect <source-port> <sink-port>	OR jack port_connect ...
jack disconnect <source-port> <sink-port>

# Some functions for sound signal level monitoring:
jack level OR jack monitor OR jack meter
	-peak
	-trough
	-rms OR -RMS OR -average
	-db OR -dB or -decibels
	histogram
	possible DC offset
	-port <name> ;# If we're allowing you to create named ports, this would be kind of necessary.

# Hmm, if separate command invocations are required for peak, trough and RMS levels, it might be problematic if the calling program is expected them to be for the same time window.  So, probably a single [jack meter] or [jack level] command that can report any (or all) measurements at once would be the way to go.


# A subcommand for transport with further subcommands?  Could base on jack_transport command, maybe with some aliases.
jack transport play | jack transport start
jack transport stop | jack transport pause
jack transport locate | jack transport seek | jack transport position
# + tempo stuff?  Timebase master/release?
