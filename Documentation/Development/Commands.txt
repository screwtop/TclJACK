What commands do I want for this thing, and what arguments should they support?  I.e. user interface design. ;^)

# Connecting to JACK server.
# Should we support multiple connections?  What would Fons do...? ;^)
# "connect" or "register"?  I think "register" is more correct; "connect" could be required for establishing port connections!
jack register [ -server <servername> ]
jack deregister [ -server <servername> ]

# Obtaining information from the JACK server:
jack query ... OR jack info ...
	samplerate
	load (i.e. CPU DSP load)
	period_size
	num_periods
	capture_ports	OR source_ports OR in_ports
	playback_ports	OR sink_ports OR out_ports
	client name (may be auto-modified by server for uniqueness)

# Managing port-to-port connections:
jack connect <source-port> <sink-port>	OR jack port_connect ...
jack disconnect <source-port> <sink-port>

# Some functions for sound signal level monitoring:
jack level OR jack monitor OR jack meter
	-peak
	-trough
	-rms OR -RMS OR -average
	-db OR -dB or -decibels
	histogram
	possible DC offset

# Hmm, if separate command invocations are required for peak, trough and RMS levels, it might be problematic if the calling program is expected them to be for the same time window.  So, probably a single [jack meter] or [jack level] command that can report any (or all) measurements at once would be the way to go.
