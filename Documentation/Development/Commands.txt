What commands do I want for this thing, and what arguments should they support?

# Connecting to JACK server.
# Should we support multiple connections?  What would Fons do...? ;^)
# "connect" or "register"?  I think "register" is more correct; "connect" could be required for establishing port connections!
jack register [ -server <servername> ]
jack deregister [ -server <servername> ]

jack query ... OR jack info ...

jack connect <source-port> <sink-port>
jack disconnect <source-port> <sink-port>
