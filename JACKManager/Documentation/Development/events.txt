# A rough stab at extracting (English language) keywords from a (possibly sloppily-formed) string:
proc string_to_keywords {search_string} {
	set stopchars "'-.,:;!? 	\n\r"
	set stopwords {a the am are of by is I you s m ve re}	;# Keep these minimal, eh - "you" could be an important keyword.  and, or, not?  Could be useful in forming boolean expressions.  Same with brackets for grouping.
	# Stopchars can be removed in one line thanks to lsearch:
	set keywords [lsearch -inline -exact -all -not [split $search_string $stopchars] {}]
	# Removing the stopwords must be done one at a time, however:
	foreach stopword $stopwords {
		set keywords [lsearch -inline -exact -all -not $keywords  $stopword]
	}
	# Could consider converting to lowercase as well.  Case-sensitivity is going to be a tough one to decide on.
	return $keywords
