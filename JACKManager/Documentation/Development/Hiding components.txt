Switched to using [pack forget] instead of [destroy] for hiding components!

Hmm, how to make the show/hide thing work?  [pack forget] doesn't reclaim the space used by the widget, it just leaves a big gap.  Can you repack the parent or something?

Empty frames are not an ideal solution either, as they occupy one pixel on the screen that I can't seem to get rid of.

Maybe my first strategy of destroying and re-creating the components wasn't so bad after all.

There are also issues with Ion's systray: the initial size is OK, but resizing the window due to toggling components doesn't trigger a re-resize, and it just draws over the rest of the statusbar.

I think grid layout is going to be the way to go.  Sizing is still dynamic, but you can put things where they belong.

Realistically, we can probably do away with many of the procs in the per-component scripts.  We only ever create them once, and we don't care about destroying.  Show and hide are probably only ever called from the set_visibility proc, but they may be worth keeping in case you need to set them to a specific state.
