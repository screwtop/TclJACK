#!/usr/bin/wish

# General JACK manager/control panel utility, suitable for popping in the desktop systray.
# (Started out as transport_mockup.tcl)

# Basic elements:
# - A button to invoke the JACK control menu, with port connection management, status info, etc.
# - Transport controls (play, stop, rewind, etc.)
# - JACK timecode display
# - Current sampling rate
# - Current CPU DSP load
# - Audio level meters (1, 2, or n?)
# - Tempo and time signature
# - XRUN count/alert

# Changing the colours of the transport buttons to indicate current state might be nice.
# Right-click menu to toggle the main UI elements in case of limited space (esp. likely when docked in systray).
# What sort of update rate for the timecode?  And meters?  10, 15, 30, 60 FPS?
# Sampling rate display also?  Could be useful if you tend to switch around a lot.
# Perhaps we could just have one JACK info panel, which could be set to display one of sampling rate, CPU load, server name, buffer configuration.  Are you likely to need to see more than one of these at a time?  Certainly having all displayed would take up a lot of space.

# NOTE: If we use Jeff Hobbs's "every" package instead of the simple "every" proc below, we can start and stop these updating for efficiency (e.g. if not being displayed and if the information is otherwise not needed by this program).

# Can we attach event handlers to variables?  Kinda like database triggers?  So if $display_timecode_component is set to false, it just disappears?  menu checkbuttons can have -command and -variable specifiec; does the variable get set first, so the command can reliabliy use it its body?

# In order to get proper layout inside Ion's statusbar, we have to set the minimum window size.

# I suspect we'll need to do something like that after every show/hide of a panel component, to get Ion to register the window size change.  Not sure if it'll take over the window sizing itself also!


# Now onward to the event loop...
